# Code Repository for Nucleosome Disassembly
This is the code repository for the paper ["Stochastic nucleosome disassembly mediated by remodelers and histone fragmentation"](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0165136).

We use julia to compute and estimate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the transition matrix. We name each script according to the model it uses. 

The parameter values are stored in profiles/.
